project_one: "Tember Defense"
project_one_description:
- "A Tower Defense game with RTS elements.<br>Solo project made in Unity.<br><br>
- Tember Defense features modular systems, that can be composed together to form new and interesting gameplay mechanics.<br>
- The heavy usage of ScriptableObjects makes the game extremely designer-friendly, as all changes can be done in the editor and stored in assets that are not prefabs.
- ScriptableObjects, like Effects and Monsters, can also be reused in multiple occassions, making balance changes easier to be kept consistent.<br>
- The way that features such as Effects, Skill, Projectile Behaviour, Units, and Buildings
- are well-defined from one another makes the code easy to customize and even extend, eg. adding a new  effect.<br><br>"

project_two: "The Dots (Working prototype)"
project_two_description: "The Dots is a high score reflex game made for the mobile platform,
which has simple game play mechanics and extensive customization options for the player's avatar.<br><br>
Solo project made in Unity. Playable WebGL build on itch.io.<br>
Currently in development for its eventual full release. <br><br>
One of the main pillars when starting this mobile game project was to focus on simplicity in game design,
as I wanted to practice on developing game feel such as the usage of Particle Systems and Sound in Unity.<br><br>
Trivia: The game's first playable prototype was done in less than a day."
